Each truck was given a road movement permit.The consignment reached the destination after two months, having covered a distance of 275.5 km, which approximately takes nine hours.Verification showed that 2601.63 quintals (2,60,163 kg) of rice worth Rs 84.98 lakh being transported by 16 vehicles had been misappropriated.This rice was not delivered at Koirengei depot but was shown in records as received, the FIR alleged.The transporter on affidavit said the delay was due to breakdown of trucks which required transhipment of the food grains through other trucks.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });It further surfaced that license numbers of transhipment vehicles, replacing trucks which had allegedly broken down, were not trucks but LML and Honda Activa scooters, motorcycles, water tankers, bus, Maruti van, cars and ghost vehicles whose numbers had not been even registered by the Road Transport Offices concerned.The license numbers records showed that two tranches of 16,300 kg and 10,000 kg of missing rice were transported by scooters and another tranche of 16,300 kg of stolen rice was transported by a motorcycle, they said.\"Non-transportation of the aforesaid 2601.63 quintals of rice to Koirengei and its misappropriation is further substantiated by the fact that the vehicle numbers mentioned in records, including the vehicles used in transhipment in respect of aforesaid 16 road movement permits, were not entered in the enroute Leingangpokpi police check-post and Keithelmanbi police check post,\" an official said giving details of the FIR.It is alleged that officials of FCI at Salchapra, Ashish Kumar Paul and Rajnish Kumar Gupta, had fraudulently issued these 16 permits without loading the rice, and L Johson, a representative of the transporter Zenith Enterprises, had falsely signed these permits, the FIR said.It said Soibam Surjit Singh of the transporter company had allegedly submitted false affidavits regarding the breakdown of trucks en route and transhipment by other vehicles.False entries of receipt were allegedly made by officials at Koirengei, they said adding that the transport company also raised fake bills of 16 trucks, they said.Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

Don't forget the UN resolutions...the first resolution of Kashmir, the Resolution No. 48, the main resolution of the UNSC was adopted at our insistence,\" Mr Tharoor, who was speaking to news agency ANI, said.Asked about China saying that they are closely watching the situation, he said: \"Let them closely watch. Closely watching is fine. We will also closely watch them. They can also closely watch. The fact of the matter is China has been complicit in redrawing boundaries in Kashmir by taking territories from Pakistan and by taking territories from us in 1962 war.\"On reports of Eid prayers passing peacefully in the Valley, he said, \"I have only been seeing media reports. I don't have any first-hand report. I am relieved that Eid prayers seem to have gone well. This final test will be when everybody including the political leaders is released from detention. When the internet is restored; the curfew is lifted; people are able to move completely freely. And then we will be able to see what kind of normalcy can be restored in Kashmir?. This is an artificial peace.\"Mr Tharoor, formerly associated with United Nations, reminded that the resolutions adopted at the UN were to be implemented sequentially and the first requirement was that Pakistan would withdraw all its militias, irregulars from the parts of Kashmir they have occupied.He said that the UN resolution was adopted paragraph by paragraph and was meant to be implemented sequentially.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"The first requirement was that Pakistan should withdraw all its militias, irregulars from the parts of Kashmir they have occupied,\" he added.\"Simple fact of the matter is when Pak refused to withdraw, the rest of the resolutions became inoperative way back then. Seventy years later, to call for implementation is slightly ridiculous particularly since there have been very serious changes in the demography and cartography of undivided Kashmir,\" he said.The Congress leader said that now Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) is 97 per cent Punjabi speaking.\"They (Pakistan) have reorganised the administration of places like Gilgit-Baltistan and given away some portion of the territory to China. After all that, they are the last one with any position to talk about undivided Kashmir and implementing UN resolutions which they have violated from the start,\" he said.\"So I think it is slightly preposterous for any of these countries to claim holier than thou attitude.

He has asked the security forces to exercise maximum restraint.\"This may be easier said than done as vested interests will use all ways and means to provoke the security forces into action, and also use social media with false narratives and rumours to whip up emotional sentiments,\" an officer said.The festival of Eid-al-Adha went peacefully in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, the government said, sharing photos of the mosques in and around Srinagar and the size of the congregation in surrounding towns. But the mood was subdued as the streets of Srinagar remained deserted under the watchful eyes of the security personnel.In a statement, the Home Ministry said large prayer congregations were seen at many places of Kashmir valley including Baramulla, where 10,000 people gathered, and in Bandipora, around where 5,000 people took part in the prayers.The state administration reiterated its denial of the city witnessing any major protest as reported by a section of the media, saying \"not a single bullet has been fired by the security agencies\".Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

I'm unable to explain it to people what nervousness is and how to deal with it because my in-built temperament is very positive. I see positivity in everything. And because of that reason, I am never disappointed.\"\"If I have to tell anything to the young generation then I will say we should not think of our life in pieces. If we think of our life as a whole then there will be ups and downs. If you are going down don''t think about it because the way up starts from there,\" he said.PM Modi\u00a0talked about living with love for nature and not exploiting it for one's own ends but leaving it for the future generations.He said India's message to the world is \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\", or the whole world is one family.When Bear Grylls asked whether he ever dreamt of becoming a prime minister, PM Modi said his focus has always been the development of the nation.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"I was the chief minister of a state first. I worked as a chief minister for 13 years, which was a new journey for me. Then my country decided I needed to do this job.

Today, if I consider this time as a vacation, then I must say I am taking a vacation for the first time in 18 years,\" PM Modi said.On being the country's prime minister, Bear Grylls asked whether he ever pinched himself.\"It never occurs to me who I am. I am above all this. When I was a chief minister and even now as the prime minister, I only think of my work, my responsibilities. My position never goes to my head,\" he added.Recalling his childhood years, PM Modi said though there was poverty, his family was always connected with nature.So much so that his father, despite there being no money, would buy 20-30 postcards and send it to relatives to inform them about the first rains in their village, he said.At one point, Grylls, who made a makeshift spear, warned the prime minister about tigers in the area that they were walking through. Modi said, \"God takes care of everything\".He said his beliefs did not allow him to kill anyone but he would hold the spear for the host.\"You should never be afraid of nature because when we think that we are in conflict with nature is when the problem starts,\" he said.Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.
